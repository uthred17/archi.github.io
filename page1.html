            <p>The <b>Houses of Parliament</b> and <b>Elizabeth Tower</b>, commonly called <i>Big Ben</i>, are among London's most iconic landmarks and must-see London attractions. Technically, Big Ben is the name given to the massive bell inside the clock tower, which weighs more than 13 tons (13,760 kg).  The clock tower looks spectacular at night when the four clock faces are illuminated.  <a href="https://www.visitlondon.com/things-to-do/sightseeing/london-attraction/big-ben" target="_blank">Click to learn more!</a></p>

           <img src="Images/rome.jpg">
        <p>Measuring some 620 by 513 feet (190 by 155 meters), the Colosseum was the largest amphitheater in the Roman world. Unlike many earlier amphitheaters, which had been dug into hillsides to provide adequate support, the Colosseum was a freestanding structure made of stone and concrete. The distinctive exterior had three stories of arched entrances–a total of around 80–supported by semi-circular columns. Each story contained columns of a different order (or style): At the bottom were columns of the relatively simple Doric order, followed by Ionic and topped by the ornate Corinthian order. Located just near the main entrance to the Colosseum was the Arch of Constantine, built in A.D. 315 in honor of Constantine I’s victory over Maxentius at Pons Milvius.<a href="https://www.history.com/topics/ancient-history/colosseum" target="_blank">Click to learn more!</a></p>

            <img src="Images/eiffel.jpeg">
            
            <p>In 1889, Paris hosted an Exposition Universelle (World’s Fair) to mark the 100-year anniversary of the <i>French Revolution.</i> More than 100 artists submitted competing plans for a monument to be built on the Champ-de-Mars, located in central Paris, and serve as the exposition’s entrance. The commission was granted to Eiffel et Compagnie, a consulting and construction firm owned by the acclaimed bridge builder, architect and metals expert Alexandre-Gustave Eiffel. While Eiffel himself often receives full credit for the monument that bears his name, it was one of his employees—a structural engineer named Maurice Koechlin—who came up with and fine-tuned the concept. Several years earlier, the pair had collaborated on the Statue of Liberty’s metal armature.<a href="https://www.history.com/topics/landmarks/eiffel-tower" target="_blank">Click here to learn more.</a></p>

                <p>The Taj Mahal is an enormous mausoleum complex commissioned in 1632 by the Mughal emperor Shah Jahan to house the remains of his beloved wife. Constructed over a 20-year period on the southern bank of the Yamuna River in Agra, India, the famed complex is one of the most outstanding examples of Mughal architecture, which combined Indian, Persian and Islamic influences. At its center is the Taj Mahal itself, built of shimmering white marble that seems to change color depending on the daylight. Designated a UNESCO World Heritage site in 1983, it remains one of the world’s most celebrated structures and a stunning symbol of India’s rich history.<a href="https://www.history.com/topics/india/taj-mahal"target="_blank">Click here to learn more!</a></p>

            <img src="Images/operahousenight.jpg">
            <p>The 40th Anniversary of the Sydney Opera House is an opportunity to explore a new story for Australia's most recognisable icon.

It is a story necessarily of its increasing entanglement with the city of Sydney, its evolution in response to changing forms of culture, and the complex relationship to Danish and Australian cultures of design.

The project of the Sydney Opera House began in earnest in 1954 when NSW state premier Joe Cahill brought together a committee to begin work on procuring "an edifice that will be a credit to the state not only today but also for hundreds of years."<a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2013-10-21/anthony-burke-on-sydney-opera-house-history/5034028" target="_blank">Click here to learn more!</a></p>
