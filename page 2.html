        <h3>1964 PONTIAC GTO</h3>

     <img src="Images/pontiac.jpg"> 
        <p>Some point to the 1964 Pontiac GTO as the first muscle car. It was born when Pontiac put a 389 cubic inch engine (used in the full size Pontiac Bonneville) into a mid-sized Tempest LeMans and dubbed it "GTO". Note that, in this instance, the GTO was actually a type of Tempest LeMans. It would later become its own nameplate. The combination was proclaimed by many auto magazines as the hottest muscle on American roads, thus connecting it to the term "muscle car". The 389 (four barrel carburetor) came standard with the vehicle and delivered 325 horse power. Optionally you could upgrade to add 3 two barrel carburetors, bringing the horsepower up to almost 350.<a href="https://www.carsdirect.com/car-buying/what-is-the-first-muscle-car-a-closer-look-at-muscle-car-history" target="_blank">Click here to learn more</a></p>

        <p>The Ford Torino was produced by the Ford motor company from 1968/1976. Described as "Ford's newest bright idea" , the all new Torino was created to eventually replace the very popular Fairlane name with an all new brand of Ford beauty, power and style. Although Ford still used the Fairlane name up through 1971, the Torino name was used on most body styles and was designed with all new looks and appeal for a whole new generation of car buyers.<a href="https://www.dearbornclassics.com/torino.html" target="_blank">Click!</a></p>

    <img src="Images/ford%20mustang.jpg">
        <p>The Ford Shelby GT500 was based on the popular Shelby GT, and was a head turner wherever it traveled. Inspired by the Shelby big-block Mustang of the 1960s, the GT500, which was a joint collaboration between Mustang customizer Shelby and Ford's Special Vehicle Team (SVT), truly was a performance-powered Mustang.<br>
Performance and Power
There are many ways in which the GT500 stood apart from other Mustangs.


For one, it boasted a supercharged 5.4-liter V8 engine capable of outputting an estimated 500 hp and 480 lb.-ft. of torque. If that wasn't not enough to win the hearts of performance enthusiasts everywhere, the GT500 featured performance upgrades throughout. For instance, it came with a MacPherson strut independent front suspension with Reverse-L lower control arms, backed by spring rates and an upgraded stabilizer for improved handling and stopping performance.<a href="https://www.thoughtco.com/2008-shelby-gt500-mustang-2465162" target="_blank">Click here!</a></p>
